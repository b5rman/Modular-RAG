Here is a chunk from the document above:
<chunk>
${chunk}
</chunk>

Write a short context (2-3 sentences) that situates this chunk within the overall document to improve search retrieval. Your context should:

- State which section or topic of the document this chunk belongs to
- Mention key entities, names, dates, or technical terms that appear in the chunk
- Note how this chunk relates to the document's main subject

Output only the context, nothing else.
